# Nonparametric Predictive Inference (NPI)
A natural starting point for statistical inference is often the assumptions of exchangeability of random quantities. To put it simply for real-valued random quantities: if one has n exchangeable random quantities, they are all equally likely to be the smallest, second smallest, etc. So, for one such a random quantity, the probability of its rank among all these random quantities is uniformly distributed over the values 1 to n
 (assuming no ties for simplicity). Bruce Hill (1968; JASA 63, 677-691) introduced an assumption, called A(n)
, where this exchangeability property is actually used directly for prediction of one (or more) future values, on the basis of $n$
 observations. He later discussed this in much more detail, and summarized his findings as:
